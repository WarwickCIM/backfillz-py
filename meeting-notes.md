## Questions for James

### plot_slice_histogram

- What are "inbetween slices"?
- `segments` argument to `create_single_plot`?
- [8 Schools example] -- μ and τ are scalars where as η and θ are vectors indexed by number of schools, not sure how 
  these are dealt with
- `line_plot`  -- y axis is iteration, color codes for iteration?
- in `fig = c(0.08 + 1 / 3, 2 / 3 - 0.08, 0.25, 0.85)`, are the 1/3 and 2/3 partitioning a virtual viewport and 0.08 
  is acting as a margin?
- in the trace plot, what does the scaling of the x and y axis into this virtual viewport?
