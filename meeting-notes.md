## Questions for James

### plot_slice_histogram

- What are "inbetween slices"?
- `segments` argument to `create_single_plot`?
- [8 Schools example] -- μ and τ are scalars where as η and θ are vectors indexed by number of schools, not sure how 
  these are dealt with
- `line_plot`  -- y axis is iteration, color codes for iteration?
