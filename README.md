# New View of MCMC

Backfillz-py provides new visual diagnostics for understanding MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analyses and outputs. MCMC chains can defy a simple line graph. Unless the chain is very short (which isn’t often the case), plotting tens or hundreds of thousands of data points reveals very little other than a ‘trace plot’ where we only see the outermost points. Common plotting methods may only reveal when an MCMC really hasn’t worked, but not when it has.
BackFillz-py slices and dices MCMC chains so increasingly parameter rich, complex analyses can be visualised meaningfully. What does ‘good mixing’ look like? Is a ‘hair caterpillar’ test verifiable? What does a density plot show and what does it hide?
